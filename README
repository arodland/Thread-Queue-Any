README for Thread::Queue::Any

Almost drop-in replacement for Thread::Queue that allows any (unshared)
data-structure to be passed between threads by means of a queue.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0-RC3 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with any
version of Perl before 5.8.0-RC3 or without threads enabled.
